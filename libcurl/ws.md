# WebSocket

WebSocket is a transfer protocol done *on top* of HTTP that offers a general
purpose bidirectional byte-stream. The protocol was created for more than just
plain uploads and downloads and is more similar to something like "TCP over
HTTP".

A WebSocket client application sets up a connection with an HTTP request that
*upgrades* into WebSocket - and once upgraded, the involved parties speak
WebSocket over that connection until it is done and the connection is closed.
