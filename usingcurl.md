# Using curl

Previous chapters have described some basic details on what curl is and
something about the basic command lines. You use command-line options and you
pass on URLs to work with.

In this chapter, we are going to dive deeper into a variety of different
concepts of what the curl tool can do and how to tell curl to use these
features. You should consider all these features as different tools that are
here to help you do your file transfer tasks as conveniently as possible.
